# TomProductDescription

Use npm run build:dev to create a bundle.js file if one does not already exist.

Use npm run start:dev to start running the server. It will run on port 3002.

If the startup page shows a price of $3.98, it is running off the dummy data and the database is probably down.
Contact Tom and tell him to turn on the database (it's probably off because he wanted to stay in Amazon's free tier)
if you want to see that it can actually connect to the database. But you're probably better off looking at
http://wowes.org if you want that, because it won't demonstrate the automatic re-rendering off any of its own actions.
